# ITERATORS
Iterators are used to point at the memory location.



### NOTE: 
- If **it** is a iterator and we use **it++** and **it+1** in array point to the next address. As we now that the data stored in array is in continuous order so it work.
- But in map or other datatype the data may be not stored in continuous order in that case we use **it++** that point to the next iterator location but the **it+1** point to the next location which is invalid.

## Operations of iterators :-

1. begin() :- This function is used to return the beginning position of the container.

2. end() :- This function is used to return the after end position of the containe

## auto iterator
> auto var = 4;  
- auto iterator is  a dynamic iterator which determine what the datatype of var
