# ITERATORS
Iterators are used to point at the memory location.



### NOTE: 
- If **it** is a iterator and we use **it++** and **it+1** in array point to the next address. As we now that the data stored in array is in continuous order so it work.
- But in map or other datatype the data may be not stored in continuous order in that case we use **it++** that point to the next iterator location but the **it+1** point to the next location which is invalid.
